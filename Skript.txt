Scene: Murder in the Kitchen
_Slow fade in from white_
Abraham: dreamyly, smiling to himself: "In my perfect world, every surface is prestine. Pictures align perfectly with the parallel walls around them, and on the windows you woun't find a speck of dirt. Everyone washes their hands for 30 seconds after going to the toilet. Nobody ever sneezes."

_crime scene investigator sneezes_, jump cut to the real kitchen, trash on the counters, dead guy in a chair. Blood is slowly dripping on the floor.

Abraham: "Unfortunately, real surfaces usually stick and real people barely ever wash their hands. My therapist says I was born with a special gift, to see the world as it should be.."

_player is urged to press the switch_, if he does, the scene goes to a world in which the dead guy is eating cereal on the table.

"I don't know. It dosn't feel like a gift to me. These imperfections, every aberration from how things should be... it just gives me a headache."

"Here's a trick my therapist told me: It's called a Rationalization."

The player is urged to inspect the guy's face. He has a scruffy beard and unkempt hair. A Rationalization pops up: "Jeremia Bright was a messy person"

If the compromise is accepted, most aberrations (trash, crooked picture) go away
